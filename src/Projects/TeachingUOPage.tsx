              I taught classes in the Computer Science department at the
              University of Oregon. I taught their undergraduate/graduate level
              Automata Theory class and the graduate level Algorithms and
              Complexity class.
            </p>
            <p>
              My automata theory class used Sipser's{" "}
              <u>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</u> book. Some topics
              included were regular languages, finite automata (DFA), regular
              expressions, regular grammars, pushdown automata (PDA), context
              free grammars, Turing machines, nondeterminism, the Cook-Levin
              theorem, complexity classes P, NP and NP-complete, undecidable
              languages and GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem.
            </p>
            <p>
              My Algorithms and Complexity class covered topics like proofs of
              correctness, algorithm analysis, amortized time complexity, divide
              and conquer, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, greedy
              algorithms, Dijkstra's algorithm, the Cook-Levin theorem,
              complexity classes P, NP and NP-complete, local search methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Students taking these classes are expected to know how to write
              clean well structured proofs. However, in practice, students come
              to these classes from a wide variety of backgrounds with vastly
              different levels of preparation. In addition to introducing
              students to topics in theoretical computer science, a major focus
              of these classes is helping students refine their proof writing
              skills.
